# Event Driven Architecture - Java (Synchronous In-Memory Implementation)

This project demonstrates the **fundamentals of Event Driven Architecture (EDA)** using a **pure Java in-memory synchronous event bus**.

The goal of this implementation is to build conceptual clarity around how services communicate using events before introducing asynchronous execution and distributed messaging systems like Kafka or RabbitMQ.

## 🚀 Features

- In-memory Event Bus
- Publish-Subscribe messaging pattern
- Multiple event consumers
- Loose coupling between services
- Simple and easy-to-understand synchronous execution flow

NOTE: Execution starts from OrderService
