# Event Driven Architecture - Java (ASynchronous In-Memory Implementation)

This project demonstrates the **fundamentals of Event Driven Architecture (EDA)** using a **pure Java in-memory asynchronous event bus**.

The goal of this implementation is to build conceptual clarity around how services communicate using events before introducing asynchronous execution and distributed messaging systems like Kafka or RabbitMQ.

## 🚀 Features

- In-memory Event Bus
- Publish-Subscribe messaging pattern
- Multiple event consumers 
- Loose coupling between services
- Simple and easy-to-understand asynchronous execution flow

NOTE: Execution starts from OrderService


## OUTPUT
Updating inventory for order1
Going to process payment for order1
Sending notification for order1
Processed payment for order1
Updated inventory for order1
Notification sent for order1
